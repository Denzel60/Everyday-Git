    <h1>What is Git?</h1>
    <h2>Git</h2>

    <p>
      is a distributed version control system (VCS) that helps developers manage
      changes to their codebase. Unlike traditional VCSs, Git thinks about data
      as a stream of snapshots. Each snapshot represents the entire project at a
      specific point in time. This approach makes Git unique and efficient.
    </p>

    <h2>Here are some key points about Git:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Version Control System: </strong>Git allows you to track changes
        to your code over time. It keeps a history of modifications, making it
        easier to collaborate with others and manage complex projects.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Distributed: </strong>Git is distributed, meaning that every
        developer has a complete copy of the repository on their local machine.
        This decentralization enables offline work and faster operations.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Snapshots, Not Differences:</strong> Git stores data as
        snapshots of the entire project, rather than just the differences
        between versions. This approach improves performance and simplifies
        merging and branching.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Branching and Merging:</strong> Git excels at creating branches
        for different features or bug fixes. Developers can work on separate
        branches and merge them back into the main codebase when ready.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Other Version Control Systems</h2>
    <h3>While Git is widely used, there are other VCSs worth mentioning:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Mercurial SCM:</strong> Similar to Git, Mercurial is a
        distributed VCS. It efficiently handles projects of any size and offers
        an easy-to-use command-line interface. Some users find it easier to use,
        especially on Windows.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fossil: </strong>Fossil combines version control, bug tracking,
        and wiki software. It's simple, reliable, and self-hosted. If you're
        looking for an all-in-one solution, Fossil might be worth exploring.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Subversion (SVN): </strong>Unlike Git, SVN follows a centralized
        model. It's widely used in enterprise environments but lacks some of
        Git's features. SVN is known for its simplicity and ease of use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Helix Core:</strong> Previously known as Perforce, Helix Core is
        a commercial VCS used by large organizations. It's robust and scalable,
        but not open source.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Remember, in this blog, we'll focus on Git and GitHub. Git is the tool,
      and GitHub is the platform where you can host your Git repositories,
      collaborate with others, and manage your projects. Happy coding! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€

    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>What Is Git?</strong> <br /><br />
        - Git is a <strong>distributed version control system</strong> used to
        manage source code and track changes over time. <br />
        - Developers collaborate on repositories to maintain the history of
        project modifications.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Features of Git:</strong> <br /><br />
        <strong>- Efficient Local Operations:</strong> <br />
        - Git performs most operations locally, ensuring speed and efficiency.
        <br />
        - Lightweight branching allows parallel development. <br />
        - Optimized merging simplifies integrating changes from different
        branches. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Git Security:</strong> <br />
        - Data integrity is ensured through cryptographic hashing. <br />
        - Access controls restrict user access and prevent unauthorized
        modifications. - Secure protocols (SSH and HTTPS) enable safe data
        exchange. <br /><br />
        <strong>Flexibility:</strong><br />
        - Decentralized development allows independent work with complete local
        copies. <br />
        - Flexible branching strategies accommodate various development
        processes. <br />
        - Easy experimentation and rollback.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Version Control with Git:</strong><br />
        <br />
        - A <strong>Version Control System (VCS)</strong> tracks file versions
        and stores them in a repository. <br />- The process of copying content
        from an existing Git repository using various Git tools is called
        <strong>cloning</strong>. <br />- A Git repository is the `.git/` folder
        inside a project, tracking all changes made to project files and
        building a history over time.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      In summary, a Git repository is a central storage location for managing
      and tracking changes in files and directories. It enables collaborative
      development, allowing multiple developers to work on a project
      simultaneously. For more info visit:

    <h2>Adding files</h2>
    <h3>Adding files to the staging area</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>What is staging</strong> <br />The staging area in Git is an
      intermediate step between making changes to files and capturing snapshots
      of these updates. It's sometimes also referred to as the
      <strong><u>Git Index</u></strong> <br />
      <br />
      To stage the a file run the command: <br />
      <code>git add < filename ></code> <br />
      <img src="./img/adding a file.png" alt="" srcset="" /> <br />
      To stage all files in a directory, run the command: <br />
      <code> git add .</code> <br />
      <img src="./img/adding all files.png" alt="" srcset="" />
    </p>

    <h3>Tracked Files</h3>
    <p>
      - Tracked files are the ones that Git knows about and includes in the
      version control system. <br />- These files were part of the last snapshot
      (commit) and have a version history. <br />- Tracked files can be in one
      of three states: <br />
      <strong>- Unmodified:</strong> The file content is the same as in the last
      commit. <br />
      <strong>- Modified:</strong> The file content has changed since the last
      commit, but the changes are not yet staged. <br />
      <strong>- Staged:</strong> The modified file changes have been added to
      the staging area and are ready for the next commit. <br />- Examples of
      tracked files include source code files, configuration files, and
      documentation files. <br />
      To check if file is tracked run the command: <br />
      <code>git status</code><br />
      <br />
      <img src="./img/git tracked.png" alt="" /> <br />
      <strong>The tracked files are highlighted in green</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Untracked Files</h3>
    <p>
      - Untracked files are not part of the Git repository. <br />- They do not
      have a version history, and Git does not manage them. <br />
      - Untracked files are everything else in your working directory that was
      not in the last snapshot (commit) and is not in the staging area. <br />
      - Common examples of untracked files are build artifacts, temporary files,
      and user-specific configuration files. <br />- You can add untracked files
      to the `.gitignore` file to prevent Git from asking you whether you want
      to track them. <br />
      In summary, tracked files are under Git's control, while untracked files
      are not included in the version history and are typically files you don't
      want to be managed by Git. Remember that Git helps you manage changes to
      tracked files, but untracked files are left untouched until you explicitly
      decide to include them or ignore them. ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€ <br />
      To check is files are untracked run the command: <br />
      <code>$ git ls-tree -r master --name-only</code> <br />
      <br />
      <img src="./img/git untracked.png" alt="" />
    </p>

    <h2>Commiting changes</h2>
    <h3>Understanding Commits:</h3>
    <p>
      - A commit in Git is like a snapshot of your entire repository at a
      specific point in time. <br />
      - You should create new commits often, based on logical units of change.
      <br />
      - Over time, commits tell the story of your repositoryâ€™s history and how
      it evolved.
    </p>

    <h3>Best Practices:</h3>
    <p>
      Make commits atomic and logical. Each commit should represent a specific
      idea or change. <br />
      Craft your commit messages thoughtfully. They should be descriptive and
      concise. <br />
      Remember that commits are lightweight and Git can handle many of them,
      even across multiple files. <br />

      To make a commit run the command: <br />
      <code>git commit -m "message"</code> <br />
      <br />
      <img src="./img/commit.png" alt="" />
    </p>

    <h2>Branches</h2>

    <h3>What is a Branch in Git?</h3>
    <p>
      In Git, a branch is like a lightweight movable pointer to a specific
      commit. It represents an independent line of development within a project.
      Hereâ€™s an analogy: think of a tree with its branches. The trunk represents
      the main part of the tree, while the branches extend from it. Similarly,
      in Git: The trunk corresponds to the main branch (usually called the
      master branch). Branches create additional lines of development that are
      separate from the main branch. When you create a new branch, it allows you
      to work on a new feature, bug fix, or experiment without affecting the
      stable codebase. The main branch remains untouched while you develop in
      isolation.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Do We Need Branches in Git?</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
      <li> <strong>Parallel Development:</strong> Imagine youâ€™re working on a project with your team.
        Each team member can create their own branch to work on specific tasks.
        For example, Alice creates a branch for a new feature, Bob works on a bug
        fix in a separate branch, and Carol experiments with an enhancement. These
        branches allow team members to collaborate simultaneously without
        interfering with each otherâ€™s work.
      </li>
      <li> <strong>Isolation and Testing:</strong> When you create
        a branch, you can develop and test changes without affecting the main
        codebase. Once your feature or fix is complete, you merge it back into the
        main branch.
      </li> 
      <li><strong>Versioning and History:</strong> Git branches provide a clear history
        of changes. Each branch represents a specific set of modifications. You
        can easily switch between branches to view different versions of your
        project.
      </li>
      <li> <strong>Experimentation and Prototyping:</strong> Branches allow you to experiment
        with ideas without risking the stable codebase. Create a branch, try out
        different approaches, and discard it if needed.
      </li> 
      <li><strong>Bug Fixes and Features:</strong> If
        a critical bug is discovered, create a branch to fix it. Once verified,
        merge it back. For new features, develop them in separate branches to keep
        the main branch stable.
      </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Creating a branch</h2>
    <p>To create a branch run the command: <br><code>git branch < branch-name > </code></p>
    <img src="./img/Create branch.png" alt="">

    <h2>Viewing all branches</h2>
    <p>To view all branches run the command: <br> <code>git branch</code></p>
    <img src="./img/All branches .png" alt="">

    <h2>Switching active branches</h2>
    <p>You can use the following commands to switch between branches: <br><code>git checkout < branch-name > </code></p>
    <img src="./img/Switching branches.png" alt="">

    <h2>Merging a branch</h2>
    <p>Use the git merge command to merge the changes from the source branch into the target branch: <br> <code>git merge < source-branch > </code> 
      <br><img src="./img/Merge Source.png" alt=""><br> Replace < source-branch  > with the name of the branch you want to merge. For instance: <br> <code>git merge feature/my-feature</code> <br><img src="./img/Target merge.png" alt=""></code>
    </p>

    <h2>Deleting a branch</h2>
    <p>To delete a branch run the command: <br><code>$ git branch -d < local-branch-name >
      </code> <br> <img src="./img/Delete branch.png" alt="">
    </p>
